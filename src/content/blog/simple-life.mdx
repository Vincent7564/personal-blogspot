Until now, i just don't get why people keep chasing everything. For me personally, i think i want to have a simple life.
A life that i don't really need to really stressing about, a life that i just can really enjoy every second of my time in this world.
A life that i think i want to cherish about in my memories. Well yeah, in life we need money, house etc. I think we just really forget what we want in this life.
Dream Wedding?, A Beautiful House in Maldives?, A Sports Car or A Designer Stuff?. I think i just doesn't really know what's that values about, Need to clarify, everyone has its own choice on life but i just write out of my curiousity.
I think, Especially for me, Simple life has a lot of values in this chaotic stuff in this world. We get rushed because of we got compared to other people achievements. We got compared because your friends have a higher salary from you.
Everything just in rush, until you don't even realize what's you working for. You save up until buy a car, then House, then Dream Car, then then then that everything you can think of.

I just only have 1 things in my mind, i don't want any more regret in this world. What i mean by this, i will and want to do the stuff i want and i have responsible for. I just trying to be myself (Which i like a lot of living on scenery places such as Forest, Ocean etc).
I think when i reach there, i just want to rejoice every single moment i create in my life. Living on your own life is more important rather than chasing up other, Seeing your friends got something new and you feel like you want it also or Tl;dr FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It doesn't make you much happier, its just perishable moments that i can said almost instantly vanish. Its just feed your ego.

Simple life is just a life where you can living out maybe a repetitive sequence everyday. But you can enjoy almost all of the time from your day. At least, for me the Happiness come from there.
As an adult, you can just working on day, chilling out on night like doing some stuff such as cooking, writing like i did now or even playing games, or even making something you love.
Its important that you have happiness since its really hard to find nowadays, Why? Simply because of Social Media that take all of them. You start scrolling, seeing your friends achievement, you get jealous, and then you start doing something that you don't even love to do.
For me as well, Happiness still a bit hard to find, cause its really need a moment, but i think i feel it a few times, its really just a core memories that it reminds you on certain action that still attach on current situation.
Simply as you meet your bestfriends and talking about the past where we got so much happy things to do, slowly you reminds it and you miss it but also you grateful that you can go through that time with them, i think its kinda blessing.

Simple life just doesn't relate in current society anymore i guess, everything just going too fast. 
When i was a kid, i love to watch Sinchan, I'm pretty sure you guys know who is him. A boy that have a certain unique action and also a bit weird as well.
But, in that Anime. It really taught me to how become an adult. Not from Sinchan, but From Hiroshi Nohara which is Sinchan Father. 
I found a piece of a fragment that [Hiroshi Nohara](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LvUN_xAxnJI) taught me in a life. Its okay to going repetition everytime as long as you going with someone you love, Rejoice the moments, and i think the most important is Do everything you want without regrets.
Regrets can be a hard pill to swallow when you old. Simple life is a choice, but i think its a choice that most people won't do anymore in this society.

**"Life is never gonna be easier, its gonna be more interesting and more exciting, 
Do anything you won't forget cause what you bring when you die isn't money, house etc. Its memories
And memories is most important things in this world"**
