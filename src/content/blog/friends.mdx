Friends, a word that contains a lot of meaning. Sometimes, you can't even describe what is friend
A weeks ago, i just meet my friends, they know me since i was in university since we had the same introduction class. 
We just meet like some random guy, trying to make friends by doing something stupid, we start as a whole group of friends,
but as time goes by, we just split into a few groups, and its just us 3 that's still together until now even we have our own life and job that needs to take care of.

I just like to meet my friends, i've been really close to these 2 guys, we talked a lot when we meet in real life, we play together, going anywhere together,
even doing a small ride when going back to a place, in 2023 until 2024, its a lot of plate that i need to take care of, and sometimes i can't stand it
there's a time i'm almost give up about my life, eventually, i just try to call one of my friends from these 2 since i know he has a lot of time at that time than my other friends that's already have a job to be done,
i just call him, tell him to come over, let's say i just need a friend talking to me. we chilling, he tried to make me relax. actually, i really grateful he come that day, i don't know if i will be here if he doesn't show up.

When i took him home a weeks ago, He asking about me how i've been this past of moment, i just said i'm more grateful, more happy, more of everything in a good way,
it's actually shocking he care so much about me as a friend, sometimes i just think that nobody really cares about me at that point that require a lot of effort.
from that moment, i just realize if i'm actually blessed, i doesn't have a lot of friends, but i think personally, i just need few, i don't think if you have a lot of friends would be great honestly.
sometimes, you don't even know who are your friends that really supports you or who will be attack you from behind, you'll never know
as you growing up, you will realize sometimes you just need a few friends, that's enough, you don't need a lot since you can't handle that much, you can't even maintain it either.
as many people said, quality over quantity, and it made sense if it comes to friends.

Personally, growing up and coming to quarter life, i'm actually doesn't really grateful about what i have, i think i just need to rush a lot of things in this life. But, as life goes on, i currently seeing that having a support friends is more than enough.
They can't 24/7 with you, but i think at some point, they will be there and you can talk about more about yourself and they'll support you. i think that's a friend that you need in life.
i'm just really grateful that i blessed with some of my friends, other friends that always ask how about me and ask me to going out together or play Valorant together. or a friend that you'll talk about some sensitive things. 

At the end of the stories i write today, i just want to say that you need to be grateful about what you have, Health, Family, Friends. slowly, you'll be missing something in your life.
What you need to do is just cherish the moment, follow the moment and just do something what you like with your friends. Honestly, life is not that great for some people. But, you can make it great if you do something without hesitation or regret.
