Work, a thing's when you grow up, you'll have to do it until the time you don't even know when to stop.
Some people, live paycheck to paycheck, cutting their cost of living for saving when you don't even know what you saving for. it can be just paid your medical bills only when you old,
They said, work life balance is something you need to do when you working whatever the role is. Some people just working more and more without care about theirselves.
I think everything needs to be balanced regardless whatever is it. Maybe some people just have their own purpose of life that required a lot of money to be realized. its totally fine i'd say
When we work for a company, sometimes you just given an illusion that you had a lot of money when it comes to at the end of the month or starting the month as you get the salary.
But, actually, its just illusion that you keep working for a company, you won't even have a lot of money at the end. Salary also a thing that keep you away from your dreams.

Working to a company is not really a bad thing anyway. Yeah, you need money to live, everything cost money in current world situation, that's sounds fair.
Everything just sounds so confusing, whether you need to work for your company but you can't reach your dreams. If you push all out like when on the morning until afternoon and continues making something to reach your dream,
You won't even have time to rest, You can't even can enjoy your life. You won't have work life balance either. Every choice looks like a bad choice at this rate.
Again, Life is never been fair anyway. Maybe, a good choice is just doing all what you like and it should be. You want to work for a company? make sure you really enjoy working on it.
You want to reach your dreams? make sure you have enough encouragement to do it in evening or weekend. Everything requires sacrifice, but "Hopefully" its worth it for all of it.

As i grow up, Finding money never been easy, working is actually not that fun. Meet a lot of kind people, starting from a good person until a very random person. 
Working is basically just doing mostly what you don't like, As an Example, you are Software Engineer, but you should repair a printer cause you are an IT. You are a UI/UX Designer, but you need to design a poster or billboard since most people think that's the same thing.
Well, you can reject it for sure, but they maybe will reject you from the company by laying you off. Enjoying your hard working earned money is good, but its just paying for your sanity when you working at the office as well.
I'd say, everything comes at a cost whenever its a cheap or expensive cost. But, i think the most important thing in working is you need to be yourself and enjoying your job whenever you don't like it.
I'm trying it, its never been easy, sometimes i want to skip what i've responsible for, but i need the money. I need to chasing a dream that going to Japan few times when i live. I need money, and basically, its your job that you got paid for to do as well.


Every people said, you need to work hard when you young and reach your dreams, but they never tell how to act when you stressing out, when you at the lowest on your life, when you thing you need to suicide and not want to live this life anymore. 
When we said like that, most people said we got a bad mentality when we try to reaching out everything on our lives. I think not everyone have the same mentality, courage, privelege to do what they want to do on their bucket list as well. Would be great if people giving out what they need to do instead of just mocking them by having a weak mentality
I will say, if you need to take a break from doing something, its fine, just take your time. You'll reach it out eventually. Currently my favorite team in Valorant, Paper Rex, have 3 times going to grand final and all of them was runner up, but they never give up, they still fighting today that they will play on 4th Grand finals.
Same like us, everything won't go well, everything will have a spiky, hole path. Not every path will be easy, everything require sacrifice. But when you already did something and you want to take of a bit. Sounds fair I'd say


For Everybody reading this, I just want to say, just doing what you want its the most really important thing, just don't be too stressed since you'll have a lot of time that thrown away cause of it.
Take everything slowly, think it and see the outcomes. Everything is gonna be okay. When i'm thinking about my life when i was a child, i just afraid getting a bad scores, but that day will pass and life must go on, we just need to fix it.
